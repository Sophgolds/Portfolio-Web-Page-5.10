   <h2> About Me </h2>
	<p> In 2018, I made the difficult decision to pursue a career rather then going back to college. I started at a pawn shop in the e-commerce department.
	    I enjoyed this position for awhile until I felt I needed something more fulling. I heard about this app called mimo, and I was hooked.</p>
	    
        <p>This app sparked the fire I was looking for. Ever since then, I've wanted to learn more and more about coding; that's why I decided to 
            enroll in Thinkful. Web developement called to me. I enjoy that this field allows me to use my logical side and creative side all together.</p>
	    
	<p> If you are looking to hire a new Web Developer (or someone to collaborate with) who is creative and detail-oriented, 
	    I'm a great choice. I want to make your dream web-site come true!</p> 
	 
    <h2> What I will be Certified in ... </h2>
	    <ul>
		    <li> Back-end Development </li>\
		    <li> Front-end Development </li>
	    </ul>
